## Projects in the works

##### [Flukey](https://github.com/josamontiel/Flukey)
**OVERVIEW:**

Generating passwords is trash, having to use lengthy passwords makes me not want to use anything online ever again, but the hard truth is that it is needed to protect data. Having a generator that can live and run right in your terminal (offline I may add) is a great way to reduce the chances your stuff gets hacked. Add in a smooth UI and now you have an app with a user interface right in the terminal that evensomeone with little knowledge of command line or terminal can use with ease.

##### [Boston Median Home Sales](https://github.com/josamontiel/boston-median-house-prices)
**OVERVIEW**

As someone who grew up in the Boston,MA area, as well as someone who was directly affected by gentrification, real estate prices in the area has always been something I kept an eye on. Not only because it was interesting to see the progression of property prices in areas that were looked at as areas where once looked down on, but it is also a glimpse into the future for other cities/towns that surround major cities nationwide. This bit of analytical work is something that will showcase the median sale prices for homes between Jan/Jun of 2021 and 2022.

## What is in the pipeline

At present I am open to working as a Data Analyst, Software engineer or work in IT in any capacity to be able to use my skills to keep data safe. Whether that is business data or just the text your're sending to your grandmother. It should all stay safe.
