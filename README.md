## Ongoing Projects

### Flukey

[Flukey](https://github.com/josamontiel/Flukey) is an offline password generator that eliminates the need for users to remember lengthy passwords. The smooth user interface, which is right in the terminal, makes it easy to use even for people with little to no knowledge of the command line. With this app, you can generate strong passwords that will protect your data from hackers.
