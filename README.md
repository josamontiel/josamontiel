# Joseph A. M.
### Data Analytics, Software Engineering, and Systems Administration


Greetings, I'm Joseph - an advocate for Free and Open Source Software with expertise in Python, SQL, Bash, and any other technology that fits the job. My focus is on OpSec, NetSec, and InfoSec, ensuring that data is always kept safe.

I believe that great documentation is essential, and that all things are possible when backed up by it. Currently, I am learning Linux and other free and open-source technologies to enhance my skills further.
Ongoing Projects

## Flukey

[Flukey](https://github.com/josamontiel/Flukey) is an offline password generator that eliminates the need for users to remember lengthy passwords. The smooth user interface, which is right in the terminal, makes it easy to use even for people with little to no knowledge of the command line. With this app, you can generate strong passwords that will protect your data from hackers.

## Boston Median Home Sales

As someone who grew up in the Boston area, I am interested in tracking real estate prices, which have been affected by gentrification. [This project](https://github.com/josamontiel/data-analysis/tree/main/boston-homes) is an analytical work that showcases the median sale prices for homes between Jan/Jun of 2021 and 2022. This project provides insights into the progression of property prices in areas that were once looked down on and gives a glimpse into the future of other cities/towns that surround major cities nationwide.

## Future Plans

I am currently seeking opportunities to work as a Data Analyst, Software Engineer, or in any IT capacity to utilize my skills to keep data safe, whether it is business data or the text message you're sending to your grandmother. I am passionate about ensuring that data remains secure and will do my best to achieve this goal.
